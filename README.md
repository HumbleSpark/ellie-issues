# Ellie Issue Tracker

This repo is for collecting issues and feature requests for https://ellie-app.com

## Rules

- Please note that our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) is always in effect and will be enforced.
- Take a look at the guidelines below for what we need from you to reach the best possible resolution.
- Show support for existing issues and feature requests using the :+1: reaction button.
- If we need more information we'll let you know with a comment and a label. We close issues without enough information after 1 week.
- If we decline a feature request or close a bug, it won't be useful to argue that it be reopened. Our time is just as valuable as yours, and we need to prioritize!

## Submitting an Bug Report

Great bug reports include as much information as possible to help reproduce the problem. 
In addition to the list of steps to reproduce, consider what your issue pertains to
and consider adding the following:

- For UI problems, one or more screenshots
- For functionality problems, a link to a saved project if possible
- For problems when saving a project, the code and list of packages

Issues that include all the needed information will get fixed quickly!

## Submitting a Usability Issue

We want Ellie to be the easiest-to-use experience for sharing Elm on the web. If you
find something about the experience difficult or weird definitely let us know by
opening an issue. Good usability issues will include a thorough explanation of why
something is hard to use. _Great_ usability issues will also include one or more
suggestions about how the experience can be improved with strong reasoning.

The more thorough the issue, the more likely we are to address it quickly!

## Submitting a Feature Request

Feature requests are a little different than bugs and UX issues. Community suggestions
are important but the direction of Ellie isn't purely based on community feedback. Time
and cost are also important factors we weigh when updating the roadmap. Feel free to show
support on a feature request by clicking :+1:, but we never guarantee that any request
will be implemented.

Great feature requests will include all the info you might find in a [user story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story).
We want to know what type of user would benefit from the feature and all the changes
that would be needed to accomplish the goal.

As a final word about feature requests, small features are more likely to be released
quickly whereas larger features will tend to be organized into broader narratives.
